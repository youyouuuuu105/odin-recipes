    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This watermelon gazpacho recipe is the perfect dish for hot summer days. In the past few weeks, I’ve gone from hot Austin to hot New York to hot Chicago. Now that I’m visiting my parents in Chicago’s west suburbs, I’m making this recipe as much as I can. I can’t think of anything as refreshing and hydrating as watermelon, so this cold soup really hits the spot. If it’s warm where you are, try it ASAP!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups cubed seeded watermelon</li>
        <li>2 roma (plum) tomatoes, seeded and chopped</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>½ English (seedless) cucumber - peeled, seeded, and cubed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced shallot</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine watermelon, tomatoes, red pepper, cucumber, shallot, lime juice, vinegar, salt, and pepper in a high-powered blender. Blend until smooth, 20 to 30 seconds. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour to allow flavors to meld and soup to chill.</li>
        <li>Stir gazpacho before serving, as it has a tendency to separate, and divide between 4 bowls. Top with feta cheese and cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
